    <p>GripIt teaches you how to protect yourself from Identity Theft and Fraud.</p>
    
    <p>Each year, not only are 16 million US residents victims of identity theft, but over 100 million additional Americans are placed at risk of identity theft when records maintained in governmental and corporate databases are lost or stolen.</p>
    
    <p>It is safe to say that your identity has probably already been stolen but you may not yet be a victim of any financial loss. GripIt will show you how to prevent being a victim and will protect you from companies trying to sell Fraud Alerts that don't really work. Fraud Alerts do not stop identity theft from occurring. They only notify you that you are a victim after the fact.....This is too late and they want you to pay for that!</p>
    
    <p>The only thing that prevents identity theft from occurring in the first place is a Credit Freeze which must be done separately with each of the three credit reporting companies and this is free of charge....but they will not tell you this if you call them on the phone.</p>
    
    <p>Enter the app now to place your Free Credit Freeze at each of the three major credit reporting companies now, and use our expert identity theft detectives to assist with your identity theft needs and or questions now and in the near future!</p>
